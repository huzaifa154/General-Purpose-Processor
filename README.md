# General-Purpose-Processor
I created a GPU to perform simple computations using an Arithmetic logic unit (ALU). I used the Quartus application to design and code 2 latches, a Finite State Machine, 4x16 Decoder, and a Control Unit. VHDL code was used to program each individual part to function in its intended way and to smoothly interact with other parts
